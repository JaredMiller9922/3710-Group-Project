We start by setting RegWrite high to write to the registers using Write Address and Write Data.
We then then set RegWrite low and both Read Addresses to the desired register and get the data back into the Read Data values. 
When we test the ALU instead of the register file, we set the aluop and opext to the instruction we want to test.
Then we read from the ALU "Output Data" instead of Read Data.
Then we rinse and repeat using the same method.
